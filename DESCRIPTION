Description: A thin wrapper around the Infernal package to search for matches to
    a covariance model in RNA sequences, or to align RNA sequences to a 
    covariance model. Infernal is not included in the package and needs to be
    installed independently. Functions to read, write, and manipulate multiple
    sequence alignments in Stockholm format are also included.
