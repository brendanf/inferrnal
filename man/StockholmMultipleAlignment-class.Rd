\item{x}{(\code{character} vector, aligned
\code{\link[Biostrings:XStringSet-class]{XStringSet}} or
\code{\link[Biostrings:MultipleAlignment-class]{MultipleAlignment}} of an appropriate
type) multiple sequence alignment without Stockholm extensions}

\item{start, end, width, use.names, rowmask, colmask}{passed to the appropriate
\code{\link[Biostrings:MultipleAlignment-class]{MultipleAlignment}} constructor,
unless "x" is already a
\code{\link[Biostrings:MultipleAlignment-class]{MultipleAlignment}}}

\item{GF}{(named \code{character} vector or
\code{\link[Biostrings:XStringSet-class]{BStringSet}}) Free-text annotations
which belong to the alignment file as a whole.  The name of each element is
a tag identifying the type of data. (See Details).}

\item{GS}{(named \code{list} of named \code{character} vectors or
\code{\link[Biostrings:XStringSetList-class]{BStringSetList}}) Free-text
annotations which belong to the individual sequences in the alignment. The
names of the outer \code{list} or
\code{\link[Biostrings:XStringSetList-class]{BStringSetList}} are tags
identifying the type of data for each element. (See Details). Names of inner
\code{character} vectors or \code{\link[Biostrings:XStringSet-class]{BStringSet}}s match
the names of sequences in the alignment, but there is no requirement that
every sequence must be annotated for every tag.}

\item{GR}{(named \code{list} of named \code{character} vectors or
\code{\link[Biostrings:XStringSetList-class]{BStringSetList}}) Annotations
for individual residues in the alignment. The names of the outer \code{list} or
\code{\link[Biostrings:XStringSetList-class]{BStringSetList}} are tags
identifying the type of data for each element. (See Details). Names of inner
\code{character} vectors or \code{\link[Biostrings:XStringSet-class]{BStringSet}}s match
the names of sequences in the alignment, but there is no requirement that
every sequence must be annotated for every tag. Unlike GS tags, the width of
all elements must be the same, and must match the width of the alignment.}

\item{GC}{(named \code{character} vector or
\code{\link[Biostrings:XStringSet-class]{BStringSet}}) Annotations
which belong to each column of the alignment as a whole. The name of each
element is a tag identifying the type of data. (See Details).  Unlike GF
tags, the width of all elements must be the same, and must match the width
of the alignment.}

\description{
The \code{StockholmMultipleAlignment} class contains a multiple sequence alignment along with its
annotations, as defined for the Stockholm file format.
}
\details{
Although the \code{StockholmMultipleAlignment} class is agnostic about the specific tags used,
the following tags are the most likely to be recognized by Infernal or other
software which reads or writes Stockholm files:
